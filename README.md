SQuAPP is a workflow-based web application built on R-Shiny to enable rapid high-level analysis of quantitative proteomics data. SQuAPP provides streamlined and straightforward access to many aspects of typical downstream analysis done with quantitative proteomics data. SQuAPP can bring multiple levels of proteomics data to process and visually compare them for further visualizations. SQuAPP provides features for the most commonly used downstream data analysis approaches and some new functionality to combine multiple data levels, e.g. protein-peptide-ptms. Here is a quick look at the functionality offered within SQuAPP.
